#About 

kabaadiwala is a network based sustainable platform dealing with the right time tracing and treatment(collection and recycle) of the black waste *.

Problem statement: Untraceable, uncollected and non recycled waste(black waste) is killing our resouces and mother earth exponentially.

=>In today's time we are consuming and using a lot of things like electronic devices, stationary, utensils, automobiles, etc. These all turn to waste after a specific point of time. The real problem is not that these things are turning to waste but the problem is that this waste is not tracked. *For the case to be precise a TV bought in a widow's home is lying in the store-room for years but what if its parts have been recyled or reused at right time. Reasons of the Problem: 1.Busy routines 2.Unawareness 3.Carelessness and laziness 4.Non carriability 5.Unreachability

Solutions: We are creating a platform named 'Kabaadiwala' to deal with this problem. So how actually we are solving this problem ....this is the questiond... 'Kabaadiwala' basically works with four features: 1.Sell - This section deals with the users who want to sell the waste in their houses by calling nearby waste collector to their houses. 2.Dump - This section deals the voluntary dumping of the waste to the nearby dumping center.User will be getting the list of all the dumping sites as well. 3.Donate - This section includes the donation of the clothes or others accessories to the nearby centre or NGOs. 4.Report - This section inludes tracing and treatment of random waste(accidental waste, stationary waste, etc.)

Target Pool: All houses in India.

Mode of Operation : Hybrid




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
