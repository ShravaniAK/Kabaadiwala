Kabaadiwala

kabaadiwala is a network based sustainable platform dealing with 
the right time tracing and treatment(collection and recycle) of the black 
waste *.

Problem statement:
Untraceable, uncollected and non recycled waste(black waste) is killing our resouces and mother earth exponentially. 

=>In today's time we are consuming and using a lot of things like electronic devices, stationary, utensils, automobiles, etc.
 These all turn to waste after a specific point of time. The real problem is not that these things are turning to waste but the problem is 
that this waste is not tracked. 
*For the case to be precise a TV bought in a widow's home is lying in the store-room for years but what if its parts have been recyled or reused 
at right time.
Reasons of the Problem:
1.Busy routines 
2.Unawareness
3.Carelessness and laziness
4.Non carriability
5.Unreachability

Solutions:
We are creating a platform named 'Kabaadiwala' to deal with this problem.
So how actually we are solving this problem ....this is the questiond...
'Kabaadiwala' basically works with four features:
1.Sell - This section deals with the users who want to sell the waste in their houses by calling nearby waste collector to their houses.
2.Dump - This section deals the voluntary dumping of the waste to the nearby dumping center.User will be getting the list of all the dumping sites
as well.
3.Donate - This section includes the donation of the clothes or others accessories to the nearby centre or NGOs.
4.Report - This section inludes tracing and treatment of random waste(accidental waste, stationary waste, etc.) 

Target Pool: All houses in India.

Mode of Operation : Hybrid
